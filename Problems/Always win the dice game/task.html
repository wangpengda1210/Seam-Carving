<h2>Always win the dice game</h2>

  <p>Our friends want to go to Las Vegas to win some money on slot machines, and we want to convince them that it's a bad idea and the casino always wins. To show them how it works we'll play the six-sided dice game with them. The game is simple: they roll the dice <strong><em>N</em> </strong>times, then we throw it <em><strong>N</strong></em> times, and whoever got a greater sum wins the bank. Our friends believe that the random generator is fair so they don't mind us giving them a generator.</p> 
  <p>Our task is to hack the system and provide a seed for the generator that wins the game for a given integer number of steps <em><strong>N</strong></em>. Let's try different seeds until we find the one that guarantees our victory, and then return the seed. Remember: our friends roll the six-sided dice first <em><strong>N</strong></em> times, and then it's our turn for the next <em><strong>N</strong></em> times.</p> 
  <p><button class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" onclick="getElementById('hint-988').style.display='inline'"> Hint </button> </p>
  <div id="hint-988" style="display:none;">
   Once we see that the seed works, we need to create a new Random with that seed since we can't roll back the existing one.
